Tailwind is the utility first CSS framework that uses 100 of classes to style so we don't need to write any new thing.

- You write class name and that's all is what you need to do. 
- You can easily integrate this to VSC so that it will auto complete your classes names.
- But you might write spagatti code with hell lot of classes so remembering them all would be    hard but you will get in with some practice.
-You won't need to write all those CSS hurray!


- You need to setup tailwind for each project. Follow the documentation
