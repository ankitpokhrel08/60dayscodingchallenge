JavaScript scope is limited to Browser only. It could not access any operating system related problems and no network related problems so then node rises to remove this problem.

NodeJs:
It is neither framework nor programming language but it is just a runtime engine or enviroment. It makes our JS code run in backend or outside the web Browser. It runs in V8 engine. 

What actually is engine ? 
Engine is something that is inbuild in Browser whose main work is to render JS code into browser.
It paints those CSS, HTML or JS into browser so we don't need to download anything extra for the same purpose. 

Now with this we now have capabilities to run JavaScript outside the browser and do 

To get the value of Java which was too much of hype back then JavaScript name was given.

NodeJs:
NodeJs is an open-source, cross-platform backend JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and execute JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- Written in C,C++ and JavaScript.

New NodeJs : Deno
Deno is also runtime based on V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language.(Same developer as NodeJs).
Came with inbuild features and is more effective then NodeJs.

NodeJs:(Terms)
Non-Blocking: Can parallely run two different tasks. 

nvm - (Node version manager) is used to work with different version of node.
Here you can install the required version and use that accrd to your compatibility.
There are so much command you can learn and use according to you convinence by typing "nvm".

Package Managers: 
They are the tools or software or program which are used for installing, upgrading, configuring or removing computer program. 
e.g.  mac: homebrew

We have package managers for different programming language and they are called libraries/plugin so that others work can be imported and do our tasks. 

Eg:
Python: pip, anaconda
php: Composer
JS: npm(node package manager), yarn, pnpm(cross betweeen npm and yarn)


Term: (REPL) --Read Eval Print Loop
It is a programming language enviroment that takes single expression and give result. Basically gave output when executing some small code like we did in python and other thing.
